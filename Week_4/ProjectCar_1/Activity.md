#Compilation in new version of Greenfoot is AUTOMATIC.

1. Modify the code so that the car can be controlled with different keys (e.g., “w”, “a”, “s”, “d”, instead of “up”, “left”, “down”, “right” in QWERTY or QWERTZ keyboard layouts).

2. Modify the code to add a method “useTurbo()” when pressed the key “t”. This method will allow the car to move forward two times faster.

3. Modify the code to add a method “useCarHorn()” when pressed the key “h”. This method will allow blowing the horn.

Tip: look for a “.wav” sound of a car horn. Put the “.wav” file in the “sounds” folder of your Greenfoot project. Use the method “playSound(String sound)” from the Greenfoot class.
